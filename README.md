I'm just sharing some testing code with someone. This repo isn't useful for anything.

* Point web root to `wwwroot` directory.
* Create a Lucee server mapping, `/deployment_root`, to the root of this project.
* Take a look at http://mysite/index.cfm, which will show some mappings. Try the links, and watch the logs.
